From Procrastination to Python: My 10-Month AI/ML Game Plan for 2025 üöÄ

Like many of us, I‚Äôve been procrastinating on my plan to dive into AI/ML ‚Äî not just to look cooler on my resume, but to genuinely deliver value to my work and solve real-world problems.

This time, I decided to stop putting it off and actually build a study plan ‚Äî one that‚Äôs sustainable and won‚Äôt derail my daily life. Let‚Äôs be honest, it‚Äôs way too easy to go all in and then fall off the wagon.

So, I‚Äôve designed a 10-month (30+ week) AI/ML learning roadmap that leaves plenty of breathing room for life‚Äôs ongoing responsibilities. It‚Äôs flexible enough to tweak, but structured enough to keep you on track.

ü§î Why this plan?
Because consistency > intensity.
Because life happens.
And because a solid plan increases your chances of actually finishing what you started.

The journey kicks off with the Google IT Automation with Python Professional Certificate ‚Äî a course I chose deliberately, because understanding Python and automation is a powerful foundation for anything AI-related.

Whether you‚Äôre starting from scratch or returning after a long pause, I hope this plan inspires you to start (and stay consistent). Let‚Äôs make 2025 the year we finally get serious about learning AI/ML ‚Äî the right way
